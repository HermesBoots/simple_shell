.SH NAME
.B hsh
- a simple shell in the style of the Bourne shell
.SH SYNPOSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ SCRIPT ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple shell that shares a general syntax with the Bourne shell. When run in a terminal, it process commands typed into the terminal. Commands can also be given directly to
.B hsh
on its standard input. Finally,
.B hsh
accepts a single argument,
.I SCRIPT
, that it will execute commands from as if they were passed as input.
.PP
.B hsh
is missing many features from the Bourne shell, including quoted and escaped text on the command line, I/O redirection, and command substitution.
.SH FILES
When
.B hsh
starts, it reads its command history from
.I $HOME/.simple_shell_history
. It also writes the history of each session to the end of this file when it exits.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.IP cd
Changes the working directory. This affects relative path names typed on the command line.
.IP env
Prints a list of environment variables currently used by the shell.
.IP exit
With no arguments, exits the shell with the status of the previous command. With a numeric argumet, exits with the given status code.
.IP help
Prints out explanation on how to use built-in commands.
.IP setenv
Adds environment variables or changes their values.
.IP unsetenv
Deteles environment variables in the shell.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP PATH
As in typical shells,
.B hsh
uses this variable to search for executables when a command is entered.
.IP HOME
This directory is where
.B hsh
stores and reads its history file.
.SH BUGS
.B hsh
behaves differently than
.B sh
in some situations, such as when encountering repeated semicolons or when it fails to allocate memory.
.B hsh
also does not handle when
.I read
and
.I write
system calls fail.
